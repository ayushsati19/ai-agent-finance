# Financial Agent Project

Welcome to the **Financial Agent Project**, a robust system leveraging **Groq AI** and **Phi Data** to analyze financial data, provide actionable insights, and interact with users via terminal or a UI. The project includes several components that work together seamlessly to achieve these goals.

## **Project Structure**

### **Files**

1. **`financial_agent.py`**
   - **Purpose**: Implements a terminal-based financial agent using the **Groq AI** model.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Provides stock analysis.
     - Fetches relevant news and analyst recommendations.
     - Offers actionable financial advice (e.g., Buy, Sell, Hold).
   - **Usage**: Run this script in the terminal to interact with the financial agent directly.

2. **`playground.py`**
   - **Purpose**: Creates a user interface (UI) for the financial agent using **Phi Data**.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Enables users to interact with the agent through a graphical interface.
     - Displays stock performance, news, and recommendations in an easy-to-read format.
   - **Usage**: Execute this script to launch the UI.

3. **`testing.py`**
   - **Purpose**: Verifies the presence of the API key (`GROQ_API_KEY`) in the `.env` file.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Ensures the environment is set up correctly before running the project.
     - Prompts for the key if it's missing.
   - **Usage**: Run this script to validate your environment configuration.

4. **`file.py`**
   - **Purpose**: Checks if a specific file exists in the project directory.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Confirms the existence of essential files required for the project.
     - Outputs results for debugging or setup validation.
   - **Usage**: Use this script during project setup or troubleshooting.

5. **`requirements.txt`**
   - **Purpose**: Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
   - **Usage**: Install dependencies with:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **`.env`**
   - **Purpose**: Stores sensitive environment variables, including the **GROQ API Key**.
   - **Setup**: Add the following to `.env`:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Install required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Ensure `.env` contains a valid **GROQ_API_KEY**.
